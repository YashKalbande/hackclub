# Facial Expression Recognition

Facial expressions convey the emotional state of an individual to observer what is at the back of mind. What we do while we speak often says more than the actual words. There are six basic types of emotions
__1.Happiness 2.Sadness 3.Fear 4.Anger 5.Suprise 6.Disgust.__

## How facial expression recognition works?
Facial expression recognition work in 2 parts:
1. Facial Detection:- The ability to detect the location of face in any input image or frame. The output is bounding box of the deteced faces.<br />
2. Emotion Detection:- Classifying the emotion on the face as happy, angry, sad, surprise, disgust or fear.<br />

## Building Facial Expression Recognition whithout writing single line of code.....
Yes! I am not joking. It is possible by using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) a fast, easy way to create machine learning models for no expertise or coding required. So lets start:<br />
1. Click [hear](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).<br />
2. Select __"Get Started"__. A new page will open with heading "New Project".<br />
3. Click on __"Image Project"__ to start trainig new image project model.<br />

4. Now create six classes, by default there are two classes avaliable. We can add more by using __+ Add a class__ option. <br />
5. Rename classes to __1.Happiness 2.Sadness 3.Fear 4.Anger 5.Suprise 6.Disgust.__<br />
![](images/AddClass.gif)<br />
6. Now is the most interesting step, we have to add image samples to each class with respective emotions. Like _smiling, happy_ images in __Happiness Class__. We have two option __Webcam__ and __Upload__ to add images. For video guide click [hear](https://youtu.be/DFBbSTvtpy4).<br />
