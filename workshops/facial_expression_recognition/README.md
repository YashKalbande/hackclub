## How facial expression recognition works?
Facial expression recognition work in 2 parts:
1. Facial Detection:- The ability to detect the location of face in any input image or frame. The output is bounding box of the deteced faces.<br />
2. Emotion Detection:- Classifying the emotion on the face as happy, angry, sad, surprise, disgust or fear.<br />
